A Pine script for Trading view.

It tracks moving-averages, incudling a whole chunk
defining which ones to use for a bunch of tickers.

The moving averages change according to zoom-level
so even at the hourly scale it's still X-days, not
hours.

It changes the background colour when they are in
bull/bear order.

It also does a TD-style count of the number of candles
a move has made. Hilights the 9s.

There is the remnents of a strategy tester.
